## üë§ About Me

I am a 23-year-old Brazilian programmer driven by a desire to understand computing systems at both the software and hardware levels. My academic background in software is complemented by a multidisciplinary interest in computer science and engineering, with a particular fascination for advanced technological domains such as robotics, industrial automation, aerospace, self-driving vehicles, and drones.

## üñãÔ∏è Programming Philosophy

As a programmer, I approach software development with a balance of pragmatism and artistry. I believe in the importance of being adaptable, ensuring I always have a backup tool at my disposal for scenarios requiring flexibility or compatibility with existing codebases. At the same time, I strive to delve deep into the underlying mechanisms of the systems I work with. Understanding how a computer works at its core enables me to write code that is both efficient and meaningful.

I am a perfectionist by nature, and this drives me to prioritize:
- Security: Ensuring my code is robust against vulnerabilities.
- Testing: Delivering reliable and high-quality software through thorough testing.
- Documentation: Writing clear, comprehensive documentation to enhance maintainability and collaboration.

For me, programming is not just about solving problems but about creating something that is both functional and elegant.

## üèóÔ∏è Current Projects

### Business Management Application
A comprehensive full-stack web application designed for a small business, using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Angular. This project serves as a strategic opportunity to:
- Translate business requirements into precise technical solutions
- Enhance skills in requirements gathering and client-centric software development
- Implement professional software design methodologies, including UML diagramming and iterative prototyping
- Gain hands-on experience in creating scalable, responsive business management tools

### Discord Bot Development
A TypeScript-based Discord bot with its own dashboard, initially conceived for a private server, but with potential for future public release. Through this project, I aim to:
- Develop practical experience with third-party API integration
- Explore advanced bot functionality and user interaction design
- Build a tool that can potentially serve a broader user base

## üß† Intellectual Pursuits and Perspectives

While technology is an important part of my professional interests, my curiosity extends into several fields. I believe each one contributes in a unique way to the individual I have become, and I would be glad if you were to take some of your time to read about them:

- **Gaming and Anime**:

- **Language Learning**:

- **Neuropsychology**: I am intrigued by the mechanisms of human cognition, and the interactions between neurobiology and psychological processes. I frequently find myself pondering about matters related to psychology and the brain, and even keep a journal to make sure I don't forget about some of my most important thoughts. As such, one of my deepest desires is to be able to help those who feel lost by offering them some guidance and hope for a better future. As I am right now, it is hard to present myself as an inspiring figure, as I haven't accomplished most of my goals in life yet. One day, however, I would feel realized upon finding that I have those who look up to me.

- **Economic Philosophy**: My interest in economics is not restricted to financial analysis, focusing instead on the philosophical underpinnings of economic systems, human decision-making, and the interactions between individual choice and broader societal structures. My interest for such things was born from the fact that from a young age I have identified as a libertarian, emphasizing individual liberty and personal responsibility, while simultaneously maintaining a strong alignment with Christian ethical principles that prioritize compassion, personal integrity, and principled living. I have also always had a passion for learning about world history and geography, and was always at the top of my class when it came to these subjects, which is something I can say I am a little proud of.

- **Strategy, Military Hardware, and Logistics**: 

## üìö Language Skills

For me, language learning is not just about communication, it‚Äôs a way to broaden my worldview, and strengthen connections with people from around the globe.

**Portuguese**: Native. As I was born in Brazil, Portuguese is my first language.

**English**: Fluent. From a young age, I have always expressed interest in the language, as it was the language all my favorite TV shows and video games were originally made in. By the time I was 11, I would already be speaking English at a reasonably advanced level, in between intermediate and advanced. From the time I was 13 up until the time I turned 17 I attended an English school, which polished my skills and allowed me to lose my fear of using the language in public. Nowadays, I continue using the language frequently to communicate with my friends from all over the world though the internet. My first proficiency exam was the MET, in which I was certified as a C1-level English speaker on the CEFR (Common European Frame of Reference) metric, and my second exam was the TOEFL iBT in which I achieved a score of 109. Both exams were taken in 2018.

**Japanese**:

**Spanish**: 

**French**:

**German**:

**Mandarin Chinese**:

## üíñ Support

At the moment, I do not have support options enabled, but this is something I may consider in the future if and when I start doing freelance projects, or whenever my projects grow in scale. For now, I am simply exploring ideas such as building a community around my projects and interests, and creating video content to share my knowledge and experiences. While nothing is set in stone, I appreciate any interest or encouragement as I continue to grow and develop in my journey.
