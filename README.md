## üë§ About Me

I am a 23-year-old Brazilian programmer driven by a desire to understand computing systems at both the software and hardware levels. My academic background in software is complemented by a multidisciplinary interest in computer science and engineering, with a particular fascination for advanced technological domains such as robotics, industrial automation, aerospace, self-driving vehicles, and drones.

## üñãÔ∏è Programming Philosophy

As a programmer, I approach software development with a balance of pragmatism and artistry. I believe in the importance of being adaptable, ensuring I always have a backup tool at my disposal for scenarios requiring flexibility or compatibility with existing codebases. At the same time, I strive to delve deep into the underlying mechanisms of the systems I work with. Understanding how a computer works at its core enables me to write code that is both efficient and meaningful.

I am a perfectionist by nature, and this drives me to prioritize:
- Security: Ensuring my code is robust against vulnerabilities.
- Testing: Delivering reliable and high-quality software through thorough testing.
- Documentation: Writing clear, comprehensive documentation to enhance maintainability and collaboration.

For me, programming is not just about solving problems but about creating something that is both functional and elegant.

## üèóÔ∏è Current Projects

### Business Management Application
A comprehensive full-stack web application designed for a small business, using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Angular. This project serves as a strategic opportunity to:
- Translate business requirements into precise technical solutions
- Enhance skills in requirements gathering and client-centric software development
- Implement professional software design methodologies, including UML diagramming and iterative prototyping
- Gain hands-on experience in creating scalable, responsive business management tools

### Discord Bot Development
A TypeScript-based Discord bot with its own dashboard, initially conceived for a private server, but with potential for future public release. Through this project, I aim to:
- Develop practical experience with third-party API integration
- Explore advanced bot functionality and user interaction design
- Build a tool that can potentially serve a broader user base

## üß† Intellectual Pursuits and Perspectives

While technology is an important part of my professional interests, my curiosity extends into several fields. I believe each one contributes in a unique way to the individual I have become, and I would be glad if you were to take some of your time to read about them:

- **Gaming and Anime**:

- **Language Learning**:


- **Neuropsychology**: I am deeply intrigued by human cognition and the complex interplay between neurobiology and psychological processes. I often reflect on topics related to psychology and the brain, keeping a journal to preserve my most important thoughts. One of my greatest aspirations is to guide and inspire those who feel lost, offering them hope for a better future. While I have yet to achieve many of my personal goals, I strive to become someone others can look up to‚Äîan aspiration that, once realized, would bring me a profound sense of fulfillment.

- **Economic Philosophy**: My interest in economics is not restricted to financial analysis, focusing instead on the philosophical underpinnings of economic systems, human decision-making, and the interactions between individual choice and broader societal structures. From a young age, I have identified as a libertarian, valuing individual liberty and personal responsibility while also adhering to Christian ethical principles that emphasize compassion, integrity, and principled living. Additionally, I have always been passionate about world history and geography‚Äîsubjects in which I consistently excelled during my studies and take pride in to this day.

- **Strategy, Military Hardware, and Logistics**: 

## üìö Language Skills

**Portuguese**: Native

**English**: Fluent

From a young age, I developed a strong interest in English, as it was the original language of my favorite TV shows and video games. By the time I was 11, I had already reached an upper-intermediate to advanced level. Between the ages of 13 and 17, I attended an English school, which refined my skills and helped me gain confidence in using the language publicly. Today, I continue to use English daily to communicate with friends from around the world via the internet.

Regarding proficiency, I took my first exam, the MET, in which I was certified as a C1-level English speaker according to the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference). Later, in 2018, I took the TOEFL iBT, achieving a score of 109.

**Japanese**:

**Spanish**: 

**French**:

**German**:

**Mandarin Chinese**:

## üíñ Support

At the moment, I do not have support options enabled, but this is something I may consider in the future if and when I start doing freelance projects, or whenever my projects grow in scale. For now, I am simply exploring ideas such as building a community around my projects and interests, and creating video content to share my knowledge and experiences. While nothing is set in stone, I appreciate any interest or encouragement as I continue to grow and develop in my journey.
