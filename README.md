## About Me

I am a 23-year-old Brazilian programmer driven by a desire to understand computing systems at both the software and hardware levels. My academic background in software is complemented by a multidisciplinary interest in computer science and engineering, with a particular fascination for advanced technological domains such as robotics, industrial automation, aerospace, self-driving vehicles, and drones.

## Technical Journey

My primary technological stack centers on Rust, leveraging the Actix web framework and SurrealDB for backend development. In parallel, I am acquiring proficiency in the MERN stack with TypeScript, ensuring comprehensive technological adaptability and the ability to work effectively across diverse project environments.

## Current Projects

I am actively developing two private projects to expand my technical capabilities and practical experience:

### Business Management Application
A comprehensive full-stack web application designed for a small business, using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React. This project serves as a strategic opportunity to:
- Translate business requirements into precise technical solutions
- Enhance skills in requirements gathering and client-centric software development
- Implement professional software design methodologies, including UML diagramming and iterative prototyping
- Gain hands-on experience in creating scalable, responsive business management tools

### Discord Bot Development
A TypeScript-based Discord bot initially conceived for a private server, with potential for future public release. This project aims to:
- Develop practical experience with third-party API integration
- Explore advanced bot functionality and user interaction design
- Build a flexible, extensible tool that can potentially serve a broader user base

## Intellectual Pursuits and Perspectives

Beyond technology, my curiosity spans several domains:

- **Neuropsychology**: I am intrigued by the mechanisms of human cognition, and the interactions between neurobiology and psychological processes.

- **Economic Philosophy**: My interest in economics transcends financial analysis, focusing instead on the philosophical underpinnings of economic systems, human decision-making, and the interactions between individual choice and broader societal structures.

- **Political and Ethical Framework**: I identify as a libertarian, emphasizing individual liberty and personal responsibility, while simultaneously maintaining a strong alignment with Christian ethical principles that prioritize compassion, personal integrity, and principled living.

## Language Skills

Beyond programming languages and the pursuits mentioned above, I am passionate about human languages:
- Fluent in Portuguese and English
- Intermediate proficiency in Japanese and Spanish
- Currently learning French
