## About Me

I am a 23-year-old Brazilian programmer driven by a profound desire to understand computing systems at both the software and hardware levels. My academic background in software is complemented by a multidisciplinary interest in computer science and engineering, with a particular fascination for advanced technological domains such as robotics, industrial automation, aerospace, self-driving vehicles, and drones.

## Technical Journey

My primary technological stack centers on Rust, leveraging the Actix web framework and SurrealDB for backend development. In parallel, I am developing proficiency in the MERN stack with TypeScript, ensuring comprehensive technological adaptability and the ability to work effectively across diverse project environments.

## Intellectual Pursuits and Perspectives

Beyond technology, my curiosity spans several domains:

- **Neuropsychology**: I am intrigued by the mechanisms of human cognition, and the interactions between neurobiology and psychological processes.

- **Economic Philosophy**: My interest in economics transcends financial analysis, focusing instead on the philosophical underpinnings of economic systems, human decision-making, and the interactions between individual choice and broader societal structures.

- **Political and Ethical Framework**: I identify as a libertarian, emphasizing individual liberty and personal responsibility, while simultaneously maintaining a strong alignment with Christian ethical principles that prioritize compassion, personal integrity, and principled living.

## Language Skills

Beyond programming languages, I am passionate about human languages:
- Fluent in Portuguese and English
- Intermediate proficiency in Japanese and Spanish
- Currently learning French
