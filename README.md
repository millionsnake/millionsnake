## üë§ About Me

I am a 23-year-old Brazilian programmer driven by a desire to understand computing systems at both the software and hardware levels. My academic background in software is complemented by a multidisciplinary interest in computer science and engineering, with a particular fascination for advanced technological domains such as robotics, industrial automation, aerospace, self-driving vehicles, and drones.

## üñãÔ∏è Programming Philosophy

As a programmer, I approach software development with a balance of pragmatism and artistry. I believe in the importance of being adaptable, ensuring I always have a backup tool at my disposal for scenarios requiring flexibility or compatibility with existing codebases.

At the same time, I strive to delve deep into the underlying mechanisms of the systems I work with. Understanding how a computer works at its core enables me to write code that is both efficient and meaningful. My choice of tools is intentional: I gravitate toward ecosystems that are logical, consistent, and empowering‚Äîwhere I can craft software as if it were a form of art. Rust, for example, is a language that resonates with my values due to its focus on safety, performance, and expressiveness.

I am a perfectionist by nature, and this drives me to prioritize:
- Security: Ensuring my code is robust against vulnerabilities.
- Testing: Delivering reliable and high-quality software through thorough testing.
- Documentation: Writing clear, comprehensive documentation to enhance maintainability and collaboration.

For me, programming is not just about solving problems but about creating something that is both functional and elegant, embodying the principles of craftsmanship and precision.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:
