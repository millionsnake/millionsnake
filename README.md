## üéØ Goals

My primary goal is to start as a back-end developer, gradually taking on more responsibilities as I refine my skills. Eventually, I aspire to become a fully-fledged Software Engineer, leading my own projects and teams in a role similar to a tech lead. It would be especially rewarding to work with international companies and teams, as I dream of traveling abroad and potentially living in the U.S., Europe, or East Asia.

## üñãÔ∏è Programming Philosophy

As a programmer, I approach software development with a balance of pragmatism and artistry. I believe in the importance of being adaptable, ensuring I always have a backup tool at my disposal for scenarios requiring flexibility or compatibility with existing codebases. At the same time, I strive to delve deep into the underlying mechanisms of the systems I work with. Understanding how a computer works at its core enables me to write code that is both efficient and meaningful.

I am a perfectionist by nature, and this drives me to prioritize:
- Security: Ensuring my code is robust against vulnerabilities.
- Testing: Delivering reliable and high-quality software through thorough testing.
- Documentation: Writing clear, comprehensive documentation to enhance maintainability and collaboration.

For me, programming is not just about solving problems but about creating something that is both functional and elegant.

## üèóÔ∏è Current Projects

### Business Management Application
A comprehensive full-stack web application designed for a small business, using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Angular. This project serves as a strategic opportunity to:
- Translate business requirements into precise technical solutions
- Enhance skills in requirements gathering and client-centric software development
- Implement professional software design methodologies, including UML diagramming and iterative prototyping
- Gain hands-on experience in creating scalable, responsive business management tools

### Discord Bot Development
A TypeScript-based Discord bot with its own dashboard, initially conceived for a private server, but with potential for future public release. Through this project, I aim to:
- Develop practical experience with third-party API integration
- Explore advanced bot functionality and user interaction design
- Build a tool that can potentially serve a broader user base

## üß† Interests and Pursuits

While technology is an important part of my professional interests, my curiosity extends into several fields. I believe each one contributes in a unique way to the individual I have become, and I would be glad if you were to take some of your time to read about them:

- **Language Learning**: Although I picked up English quickly, it wasn‚Äôt due to a general interest in language learning. However, as my fascination with Japanese culture grew through anime, I decided to actively pursue learning Japanese. Since then, studying the language of a culture I enjoy or have friends from has become a rewarding experience. It allows me to see the world from a different perspective and challenges me to think in new ways.

- **Self-improvement**: One of my greatest aspirations is to be able to use my knowledge and experiences to inspire those who are in need of guidance. Though I have yet to achieve many of my personal goals, I strive to become someone others can one day look up to or feel grateful for‚Äîwhether through the insights I share or the help I provide. Knowing that my knowledge has made a difference in someone‚Äôs life would be a fulfilling achievement.

- **Economic Philosophy**: My interest in economics is not restricted to financial analysis, focusing instead on the philosophical underpinnings of economic systems, human decision-making, and the interactions between individual choice and broader societal structures. From a young age, I have identified as a libertarian, valuing individual liberty and personal responsibility while also adhering to Christian ethical principles that emphasize compassion, integrity, and principled living. Additionally, I have always been passionate about world history and geography‚Äîsubjects in which I consistently excelled during my studies and take pride in to this day.

- **Gaming**: Gaming has always been one of my favorite pastimes, and in recent years, I have gravitated toward story-rich single-player experiences and cooperative multiplayer games that allow me to create meaningful memories with friends. While primarily a form of entertainment, some games offer deep lore, rich character backstories, and opportunities to develop teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills. Some of my favorite games include Helldivers 2, VRChat, and Genshin Impact.

- **Anime**: Japanese anime has held a special place in my heart since I was fifteen. At the time, shows like Angel Beats! provided comfort, allowing me to laugh, cry, and connect with characters in ways that helped me navigate daily life. Anime became a meaningful escape during a difficult period marked by the typical struggles of adolescence.

- **Military Hardware and Strategy**: A bit on the unorthodox side, my interests also extend to military aircraft, helicopters, tanks, artillery systems, and other weaponry and equipment. This passion naturally ties into my love for real-time strategy (RTS) and grand strategy games, where I have spent countless hours playing titles like Total War, Wargame, and Stellaris.

## üìö Language Skills

**Portuguese**: Native

**English**: Fluent

- From a young age, I developed a strong interest in English, as it was the original language of my favorite TV shows and video games. By the time I was eleven, I had already reached an upper-intermediate to advanced level. Between the ages of thirteen and seventeen, I attended an English school, which refined my skills and helped me gain confidence in using the language publicly. Today, I continue to use English daily to communicate with friends from around the world via the internet.

- In 2018, I took both the MET and the TOEFL iBT. I was certified as a C1-level English speaker on the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference) through the MET and achieved a score of 109 on the TOEFL.

**Japanese**: Intermediate

- As mentioned in my anime section, my love for Japanese media sparked my interest in learning the language. Nearly a decade has passed since then, and although my studies were on and off for much of that time, I have now reached a level where I can watch most of my favorite shows without relying too much on subtitles and understand most casual conversations. My biggest goal at the moment is to overcome my fear of speaking the language in public, as I have done with English.

- In 2023, I took the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) and attained N3-level proficiency. I am currently working toward N2 certification, with my ultimate goal being N1-level mastery.

**Spanish**: Intermediate

- While I do not have any official certifications in Spanish, my proficiency is comparable to my Japanese skills. I studied the language for six years during middle school and high school and have made many online friends who are native or second-language Spanish speakers. Through these interactions, I have developed a strong comprehension of spoken and written Spanish.

- However, much like with Japanese, my hesitation to actively use the language has made my spoken Spanish feel somewhat unnatural. Overcoming this fear and gaining confidence in speaking fluently is, here too, my next goal.

**French**: Beginner

**German**: Intend to learn

**Mandarin Chinese**: Intend to learn

## üíñ Support

At the moment, I do not have support options enabled, but this is something I may consider in the future if and when I start doing freelance projects, or whenever my projects grow in scale. For now, I am simply exploring ideas such as building a community around my projects and interests, and creating video content to share my knowledge and experiences. While nothing is set in stone, I appreciate any interest or encouragement as I continue to grow and develop in my journey.
