## Welcome to my profile!

I'm Alessandro, a Software Engineering undergraduate student born and raised in Brazil. Although my current major is more focused on the Software Development side of things, I also have a passion for understand how computers actually work from the ground up, which at one point even made me switch majors to Computer Engineering for a while. Both majors have contributed to my way of viewing things, and I will very likely keep seeking to understand both points of view through self-studying.

Currently, I'm mostly working on whatever my university tells me to do, however I do have a few side projects (mostly private as of yet) here and there. So far, I am relatively comfortable working with C/C++, Arduino, Java and HTML/CSS. Other technologies such as JavaScript, Python, and Rust are still new to me, but I expect to grow more familiar with them as I develop my future projects, either personal or for university, using these tools.

Another one of my passions is language learning, so I might even dabble in translation work in the future. Currently, I can speak Portugese, English, Spanish, and Japanese to varying degrees, and I plan on learning even more languages soon, such as French and Mandarin. With this knowledge, I hope to one day be able to live in and travel to different places all around the world. This way, I can meet with online friends and perhaps even make new ones throughout the journey.

Lastly, I also have a massive interest on anything to do with airplanes, helicopters, rockets, and even military equipment in general. So embedded computing, IoT, and getting to see the software I helped develop interfacing with things out there in the physical world (drones, self-driving vehicles, augmented reality...) could be a source of great satisfaction for me one day.

Feel free to reach out to me if anything has piqued your interest, as I feel this document is becoming far too verbose already.

I will update it with better visuals and info whenever I get the time.
