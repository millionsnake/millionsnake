# About Me

I am a dedicated programmer committed to deepening my technical expertise and evolving into a comprehensive software engineer. My current focus is on building robust and efficient systems, with a principled approach to technology selection and implementation.

## Technical Journey

My primary technological stack centers on Rust, leveraging the Actix web framework and SurrealDB for backend development. While I am passionate about these modern technologies, I maintain pragmatic flexibility by simultaneously developing proficiency in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with TypeScript. This strategic approach ensures adaptability across different project requirements and technological ecosystems.

## Language Skills

Beyond programming languages, I am passionate about human languages:
- Fluent in Portuguese and English
- Intermediate proficiency in Japanese and Spanish
- Currently learning French

My enthusiasm for languages extends both to programming and communication, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and cross-cultural understanding.
