## üë§ About Me

I am a 23-year-old Brazilian programmer driven by a desire to understand computing systems at both the software and hardware levels. My academic background in software is complemented by a multidisciplinary interest in computer science and engineering, with a particular fascination for advanced technological domains such as robotics, industrial automation, aerospace, self-driving vehicles, and drones.

## üñãÔ∏è Programming Philosophy

As a programmer, I approach software development with a balance of pragmatism and artistry. I believe in the importance of being adaptable, ensuring I always have a backup tool at my disposal for scenarios requiring flexibility or compatibility with existing codebases. At the same time, I strive to delve deep into the underlying mechanisms of the systems I work with. Understanding how a computer works at its core enables me to write code that is both efficient and meaningful.

I am a perfectionist by nature, and this drives me to prioritize:
- Security: Ensuring my code is robust against vulnerabilities.
- Testing: Delivering reliable and high-quality software through thorough testing.
- Documentation: Writing clear, comprehensive documentation to enhance maintainability and collaboration.

For me, programming is not just about solving problems but about creating something that is both functional and elegant.

## üèóÔ∏è Current Projects

### Business Management Application
A comprehensive full-stack web application designed for a small business, using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Angular. This project serves as a strategic opportunity to:
- Translate business requirements into precise technical solutions
- Enhance skills in requirements gathering and client-centric software development
- Implement professional software design methodologies, including UML diagramming and iterative prototyping
- Gain hands-on experience in creating scalable, responsive business management tools

### Discord Bot Development
A TypeScript-based Discord bot with its own dashboard, initially conceived for a private server, but with potential for future public release. Through this project, I aim to:
- Develop practical experience with third-party API integration
- Explore advanced bot functionality and user interaction design
- Build a tool that can potentially serve a broader user base

## üß† Intellectual Pursuits and Perspectives

While technology forms the core of my professional interests, my curiosity extends into several diverse fields:

- **Neuropsychology**: I am intrigued by the mechanisms of human cognition, and the interactions between neurobiology and psychological processes.

- **Economic Philosophy**: My interest in economics is not restricted to financial analysis, focusing instead on the philosophical underpinnings of economic systems, human decision-making, and the interactions between individual choice and broader societal structures.

- **Political and Ethical Framework**: I identify as a libertarian, emphasizing individual liberty and personal responsibility, while simultaneously maintaining a strong alignment with Christian ethical principles that prioritize compassion, personal integrity, and principled living.

## üìö Language Skills

In addition to programming languages, I am passionate about human languages and the connections they foster across cultures:
- Fluent: Portuguese and English
- Intermediate: Japanese and Spanish
- Currently Learning: French
- Future Goals: Mastering Mandarin and German.

For me, language learning is not just about communication, it‚Äôs a way to broaden my worldview, and strengthen connections with people from around the globe.

## üíñ Support

At the moment, I do not have support options enabled, but this is something I may consider in the future if and when I start doing freelance projects, or whenever my projects grow in scale. For now, I am simply exploring ideas such as building a community around my projects and interests, and creating video content to share my knowledge and experiences. While nothing is set in stone, I appreciate any interest or encouragement as I continue to grow and develop in my journey.
